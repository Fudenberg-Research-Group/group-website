 abstract = {We present Micro-C XL, an improved method for analysis of chromosome folding at mononucleosome resolution. Using long crosslinkers and isolation of insoluble chromatin, Micro-C XL increases signal-to-noise ratio. Micro-C XL maps of budding and fission yeast genomes capture both short-range chromosome fiber features such as chromosomally interacting domains and higher order features such as centromere clustering. Micro-C XL provides a single assay to interrogate chromosome folding at length scales from the nucleosome to the full genome.},
