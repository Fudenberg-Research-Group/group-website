 abstract = {Recently, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) based experiments have highlighted the importance of computational models for the study of chromosome organization. In this review, we propose that current computational models can be grouped into roughly four classes, with two classes of data-driven models: consensus structures and data-driven ensembles, and two classes of de novo models: structural ensembles and mechanistic ensembles. Finally, we highlight specific questions mechanistic ensembles can address.},
