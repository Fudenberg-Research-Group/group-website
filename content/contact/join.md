## Join  
We are always looking for students and postdocs to collaborate with on our journey to understand genome organization and function. We have had fruitful collaborations with researchers with backgrounds ranging from theoretical physics, to computer science, to biology.  
&nbsp;  
Prospective PhD students should apply to USCâ€™s [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB)](https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/qcb/phd-program/) program and arrange a rotation. Note that admissions are handled by the committee and not by individual groups, but feel welcome to send questions or statements of interest via email.  
&nbsp;  
Prospective postdocs should send via email a 1-2 page cover letter with a description of their past and future research interests, including how these would be enriched by time in our group, as well as a CV and contact information for 3 references.
