## Software

We actively develop computational tools with the [Open Chromosome Collective (Open2C).](https://github.com/open2c) 

Open2C repositories under active development include:
- [`bioframe`:](https://github.com/open2c/bioframe) flexible workflows with genomic interval dataframes.
- [`cooltools`:](https://github.com/open2c/cooltools) analysis of chromosome conformation data stored in the cooler format.
- [`polychrom`:](https://github.com/open2c/polychrom) for biophysical models of chromosome folding.

For neural network models of genome folding see:
- [`akita`:](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita) for predicting mammalian interphase genome folding from DNA sequence
