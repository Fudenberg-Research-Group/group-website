> _How do nano-scale interactions between proteins organize micron-long chromosomes?_  
>  
> _Which DNA sequences specify when & how this organization occurs?_  
>  
> _How does genome organization influence gene regulation?_  
  
These questions guide our studies of DNA sequence, 3D genome organization, & genome functions. We draw on approaches used in computational physics and machine learning to understand these biological questions. We dream of eventually being able to read in any genomic sequence and predict how it organizes in 3D. In turn, we hope to understand how genome organization impacts processes from gene regulation to recombination, how genome organization varies between cell types, and how it has varied over the course of evolution.
