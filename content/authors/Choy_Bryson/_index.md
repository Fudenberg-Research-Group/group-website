Bryson is a concurrent BS/MS student in the [Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu) at USC. 
He has worked with [Vsevolod Katritch](https://katritch.usc.edu) in the area of computational structural biology and mathematical modeling, as well as [Mitch Guttman](https://guttmanlab.caltech.edu) at Caltech, focused on the development of new experimental and computational tools toward understanding gene regulation. He has also held research positions at the [University of Hawaii Cancer Center](https://www.uhcancercenter.org) working with Dana-Lynn Ko'omoa-Lange and the [USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics](https://healthpolicy.usc.edu) working with William Padula.

His thesis work in the Fudenberg lab focuses on the interpretation of deep learning models for exploring the interplay between CTCF and TF binding motifs in the context of 3D genome organization and nuclear compartmentalization.
