At USC, Vamsi was a concurrent BS/MS student in the [Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu). 
He worked with [Pinchas Cohen](https://gero.usc.edu/labs/cohenlab/) in the area of computational biology and gerontology toward understanding the role of mitochondrial-derived peptides in aging. His work in the Fudenberg lab focused on understanding patterns of CTCF binding across cell types and how they may relate to 3D genome organization. 

After graduation, Vamsi started as an analyst at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vbchavali).
