Vamsi is a concurrent BS/MS student in the [Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu) at USC. 
He has worked with [Pinchas Cohen] in the area of computational biology and gerontology toward understanding the role of mitochondrial-derived proteins in aging. 

His work in the Fudenberg lab focuses on the exploring the interplay between CTCF and TF binding motifs in the context of 3D genome organization.
