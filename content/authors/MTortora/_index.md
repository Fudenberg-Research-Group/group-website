Max Tortora is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/qcb/) at USC. Max completed his D.Phil. (PhD) in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Oxford, based in the group of [Jonathan Doye](http://doye.chem.ox.ac.uk/jon/). There, he studied the self-assembly and liquid-crystalline behavior of DNA-based nanomaterials using various theoretical and numerical methods. He then moved to the group of [Daniel Jost](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/daniel.jost/DanielJost/Home.html) at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, where he worked on various problems related to chromosome organization and nuclear membrane mechanics, in close collaboration with experimental biologists. In the Fudenberg group, he develops computational tools to investigate the interplay between loop extrusion and higher-level chromatin folding processes, such as compartmentalization.
