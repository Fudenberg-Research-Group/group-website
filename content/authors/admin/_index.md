Geoff Fudenberg is an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/qcb/) at USC.  Geoff received a Ph.D. in Biophysics from Harvard University, working with [Leonid Mirny](http://mirnylab.mit.edu) at MIT. He conducted postdoctoral work at the Gladstone Institute of Data Science and Biotechnology with [Katie Pollard.](https://docpollard.org) 

His work aims to connect molecular-scale mechanisms with their genome-wide consequences, and uses machine-learning and biophysical modeling approaches to decode connections between 3D genome organization and function.
