Ria Pai received a B.S. in [Quantitative Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu) and a minor in [Disruptive Innovation](https://iovine-young.usc.edu/learn/undergraduate/learn-minors). She previously worked with [Dr. Suhn K. Rhie](https://sites.usc.edu/rhielab/) integrating RNA-seq data to understand gene regulation, how it translates to transcriptome changes, and aided in the creation of a larger R package that can be used to detect epigenetic changes in any dataset. In the Fudenberg lab, she assessed whether a panel of Hi-C datasets had sufficient quality for training neural network models and made human vs. mouse predictions for contact maps with Akita.
