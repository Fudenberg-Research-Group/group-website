Paulina is a Graduate Student pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics in the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology. She received a B.S. in Biotechnology from the College of Inter-faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Science at the University of Warsaw, Poland. During her undergraduate, Paulina worked on the biochemical and bioinformatic characterization of Hh1412 from Helicobacter hepaticus presumably functioning as thiol:disulfide interchange protein under the supervision of Paula Roszczenko-Jasinska, Ph.D. As an undergraduate researcher, she worked in the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Biological Systems Modeling under Prof. Joanna I. Sulkowska supervision, where she investigated the evolutionary origins of the slipknot topology in proteins.        
Paulina is interested in the molecular aspects of genome organization, its dynamics, and its role in gene regulation. She focuses on employing interpretable deep learning models for revealing principles of nuclear organization of mammalian genomes.
