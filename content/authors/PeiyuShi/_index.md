Peiyu is a Graduate Student pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics in the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology. She received a B.S. in Biological Science and a M.S. in Bioinformatics from Sun Yat-sen University, China. During her undergraduate and master, she used integrative single-cell genomics analyses to investigate how transcription factors regulate genes and contribute to cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variations under the supervision of Prof. Jin Xu. 
Peiyu is interested in developing and using interpretable deep learning models to uncover the principles of genome folding and translate these insights into real-world applications in biomedicine and precision health.
