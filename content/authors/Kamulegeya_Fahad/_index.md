Fahad is a research technician in the Department of [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/). 
He got a Bachelors in Physics from [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug), Uganda.
He then obtained a Post Graduate Diploma in Quantitative Life Sciences at the [International Center for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it), Italy.
He was a research technichian at the [Institute of Molecular Biotechnology](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/imba/home) in Austria, modelling chromatin dynamics in the [Goloborodko Lab](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/imba/research/anton-goloborodko). 

He uses computational tools to decipher the link between chromatin dynamics, 3D genome organization and gene expression.
